Contents: The project contains three files, Shard, Client and
	include. In include it contains all external library, e.g.,
	Base64, Gson and some parsing java class I used for final 
	project.

	in Shard, it contains a configuration.json and a server.java

	in Client, it contains a configuration.json and a client.java

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation instructions:

Everything can be simply done by 

	cd Shard

	make

	cd Client

	make

All makefiles in Shard and Client also executes test example from command line.
So it means if you want to test for the other files, you should manually change
the command line in makefile, i.e., 

	the -upload/-download and the kobe.jpg in command line below:

	java -cp .:../include/ SimpleFileClient -config configuration.json -upload kobe.jpg


It's not trivial to test, but at least very easy by just typing make for a small test, as
long as it's only a small project milestone. Further I would generate .jar and provide a
better command line example

Right now I didn't enable Gson string communication correctly. Given enough time
I would have it done. But submitting a program which can work is at least better than a program
can't work even it can be compiled
