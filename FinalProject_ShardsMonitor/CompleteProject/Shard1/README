/************************* Folder Description ***************************************/

This is the Shard folder, which contains Shard.java as Standard java class 

for all shard computations. Besides, it has configuration.json which performs

as configuration files.

The ShardAPI.html generated by javadoc listing not complete Shard API. I don't

know why only main functions are shown. Actually I've more than ten API inside...


/************************** Compilation Instructions ********************************/

    make

/************************** html documentation ********************************/

My ShardAPI.html can't show the complete function list. My Shard class has

more than just one main function

ProtocolDocumentation contains all .html as my communication procotols. Since I design

may derived classes, I failed to compress all class into just one html.
